# Configuration

Every lagom-pb based application must include the `lagompb.conf` into the `application.conf`. 

Kindly check the `lagompb.conf` file to see the various environment variables and configuration settings that can be 
overridden in the `application.conf`.

For the readSide implementation kindly check the `reference.conf` of **_lagompb-readside package_** to see the various environment
variables and configuration settings that can be overridden in the `application.conf`.
