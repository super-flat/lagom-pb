Scala shared code for [lagom](https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.6.x/scala/Home.html) development using protocol buffer.

This library helps write lagom microservices easily by making use of protocol buffer messages to define the es/cqrs core
components like _**api requests/responses**_, _**grpc services**_, _**events**_, _**commands**_ and _**state**_.

## Features

- Implementation of an HTTP/Json based microservice using REST interfaces by defining _**api requests and responses as protobuf messages**_.

- Implementation of a gRPC based microservice using protocol buffer messages. More info: [gRPC](https://grpc.io/).

- ReadSide in-built battery via ([Akka Projection](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-projection/current/)).

- Easy definition of aggregate root, events and command handlers.

- Pure testable functions for events and commands handlers.

- Easy definition of api service descriptors.

- Easy implementation of api service either with message broker api or without.

- Metadata adds some `revision number` that can help easily implement optimistic lock.

- At every event handled a snapshot of the aggregate state with the metadata are made available for the readSide.

- All events, snapshots and readSide offsets are persisted to Postgres SQL.

- Encryption trait to enable events and snapshots encryption.

## Get Started

1. Add to your `plugins.sbt`:

```scala
val LagompbVersion = "x.x.x"
addSbtPlugin("io.superflat" % "lagompb-plugin" % LagompbVersion)
```

2. Add to your `build.sbt`:

```scala
val LagompbVersion = "x.x.x"
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "io.superflat" %% "lagompb-core" % LagompbVersion,
  "io.superflat" %% "lagompb-core" % LagompbVersion % "protobuf"
)
```

## Using lagom-pb
