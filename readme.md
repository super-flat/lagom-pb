Scala shared code for [lagom](https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.6.x/scala/Home.html) development using protocol buffer. 

This library helps write lagom microservices easily by making use of protocol buffer messages to define the es/cqrs core
components like _**api requests/responses**_, _**grpc services**_, _**events**_, _**commands**_ and _**state**_. 

## Features

- Implementation of an HTTP/Json based microservice using REST interfaces by defining _**api requests and responses as protobuf messages**_. 
- Implementation of a gRPC based microservice using protocol buffer messages. More info: [Grpc](https://grpc.io/).
- Kafka producer in-built battery([message broker api](https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.6.x/scala/MessageBrokerApi.html)) to publish domain events to kafka as serialized protocol buffer messages.
- Easy definition of aggregate root, events and command handlers.
- Pure testable functions for events and commands handlers.
- Easy definition of api service descriptors either with message broker api or without.
- Easy implementation of api service either with message broker api or without.
- Meta data adds some `revision number` that can help easily implement optimistic lock.  
- At every event handled a snapshot of the aggregate state with the meta data are made available for the readSide.
- All events and snapshots are by default persisted to Postgres SQL.
